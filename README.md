I'm building a site that displays the affiliations that rappers/dj's have to other rappers and dj's.
The plans and scope of this project definitely may change.  But Here are some user stories and
the general structure of the app as of 6/26/2016:

User Stories:

Users can search through all artists or all crews via a search box on the site's main page.
The results of the search are displayed in a list.

Users can click on an artist or crew in the list and see the other affiliated artists
or see all crew members.  The clicked artist/crew affiliates are displayed as markers
on a map at their respective location.

Users can see info for each artist/crew at individual profile pages

App structure

I'm building out the front end with Angular to make it an SPA with 2 - 3 states/views
and make AJAX calls to the API grab all the artist/crew info.

The backend is an API to for sending the artist/crew info to the browser in json,
building with Rails and Postgres.

I want to focus mostly on bettering my front-end skills, but I'm doing whatever I have to
in order to make it work.  So, I figured SQL would be the easiest way for me to
handle relationships between artists and each other, and I'm already a bit familiar
with Rails so that's what I'm running with.  Feel free to work on this with me,
especially if you're good with Rails backend!
